## Development

### Installing Dependencies

- Then open your terminal and browse to the location of your UnderStrap copy
- Run: `$ npm install`

### Running

1. Get WordPress running and note down the URL for step 5
2. Add `devsupport/browser-sync.crt` to your browser's or operating system's trusted certificate store (*optional* but [recommended in order to debug with Chrome]())
3. Make sure you have installed Node.js on your computer globally
4. Then open your terminal and browse to the location of your UnderStrap copy
5. Run e.g.: `$ npm start -- --url=https://localhost/sti --browser=chrome`<br/>ðŸ’¡ For Mac OS X, use `--browser="Google Chrome"` instead.

### Directory layout

- Files read by WordPress directly:  `index.php`, `style.css` (the browser never sees that one)
- Serving directories: `css/`, `js/` â€” may contain source files, as well as files generated by Gulp
- Source files for the client (non-serving-state; must be processed with Gulp): `src/`, `sass/`
- PHP templates for the overall site layout: `header.php`, `footer.php`
- PHP templates for specific pages: `tribe-events/single-event.php`, `loop-templates/*.php`

### SCSS basics

The `/css/theme.css` and its minified little brother `/css/theme.min.css` file(s) provides most of the styles. It is composed of five different SCSS sets and one variable file at `/sass/theme.scss`. Read the comments there for a quick orientation session. Add your designs to /sass/theme/_theme.scss` and your variables to `/sass/theme/_theme_variables.scss`.
